I (cmkrist) have no rights or ownership to the files found in this repository.
All files are generated using dlss-enabler-setup-3.02.000.0.exe found in Artur Graniszewski's repository [here](https://github.com/artur-graniszewski/DLSS-Enabler/releases/tag/3.02.000.0).

These files are being hosted here due to the nature of being a generated file from Windows being used on Linux to prevent constant generations across devices and enable seamless integration with other scripts.
